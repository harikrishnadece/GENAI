Act as LLM expert and get me the Vision models from different service provides (aprat from groq)





The following provides a landscape of vision-capable AI models categorized by their **Service Provider**.

Since you requested models generally available via API or cloud services (excluding Groq), these are the major alternatives offering state-of-the-art multimodal (Vision-Language) capabilities.

### 1. OpenAI

OpenAI is currently the industry standard for general-purpose vision models, known for high reliability and strong reasoning on visual inputs.

* **Key Models:**
* **GPT-4o (Omni):** Their flagship multimodal model. It is faster and more cost-effective than previous versions and has native multimodal capabilities (audio, vision, text) trained into a single model.
* **GPT-4o Mini:** A smaller, cost-efficient variant that retains vision capabilities, ideal for high-volume tasks like receipt scanning or simple image moderation.
* **GPT-4 Turbo with Vision:** The predecessor to 4o, still widely used but generally slower and more expensive.


* **Best For:** Complex visual reasoning, OCR (extracting text from images), chart analysis, and describing detailed scenes.

### 2. Google Cloud (Vertex AI)

Google has integrated vision deeply into its "Gemini" family of models, offering massive context windows that can handle video natively (not just static images).

* **Key Models:**
* **Gemini 1.5 Pro:** A mid-to-large sized model with a **2 million token context window**. It can process long videos (up to an hour) and answer questions about specific frames or events within them.
* **Gemini 1.5 Flash:** A lightweight, extremely fast model designed for high-frequency, low-latency vision tasks.
* **Imagen 3:** specialized strictly for *image generation* (text-to-image), though often bundled in the same API suite.


* **Best For:** Video analysis, analyzing large batches of images simultaneously, and multimodal retrieval (finding a specific moment in a video).

### 3. Anthropic

Anthropic's Claude models are highly regarded for their "safety" and reduced refusal rates on benign images, as well as distinctively strong performance in reading handwriting and coding from screenshots.

* **Key Models:**
* **Claude 3.5 Sonnet:** Currently widely considered the SOTA (State of the Art) for coding and visual nuance. It excels at transcribing handwritten notes and converting UI screenshots into functional code (HTML/CSS).
* **Claude 3.5 Haiku:** Their fastest model, competing directly with GPT-4o Mini and Gemini Flash for speed-critical vision tasks.
* **Claude 3 Opus:** The largest legacy model, powerful but slower; mostly superseded by 3.5 Sonnet.



* **Best For:** Converting UI designs to code, reading cursive/handwriting, and highly nuanced image description.

### 4. Amazon Web Services (AWS Bedrock)

AWS Bedrock is a "model garden" that hosts models from various third-party providers as well as Amazon's own.

* **Key Models:**
* **Amazon Nova:** Amazon's newly released proprietary foundation models which include multimodal (vision) support.
* **Llama 3.2 Vision (via Meta):** Bedrock hosts Meta's open-weights models. The Llama 3.2 11B and 90B variants are vision-capable.
* **Anthropic Claude:** You can access the full Claude 3.5 suite via Bedrock.
* **Amazon Titan Image Generator:** For image creation (inpainting, outpainting).


* **Best For:** Enterprises already in the AWS ecosystem needing compliance/security, and users who want to switch between different model providers (e.g., Meta vs. Anthropic) using a single API.

### 5. Microsoft Azure

Azure offers a mix of OpenAI models and their own specialized computer vision models ("Small Language Models" or specialized vision APIs).

* **Key Models:**
* **Azure OpenAI Service:** Hosts GPT-4o and GPT-4o Mini.
* **Florence-2:** A highly efficient, small vision model developed by Microsoft. It is excellent for tasks like object detection, captioning, and segmentation, and is much cheaper/faster than a full LLM.
* **Phi-3 / Phi-3.5 Vision:** Microsoft's open-weights "Small Language Model" (SLM) that is surprisingly capable at vision tasks despite being small enough to run on local devices or cheaper cloud instances.


* **Best For:** Enterprise integration, specialized "classic" computer vision tasks (segmentation/detection) via Florence, and hybrid cloud setups.

### 6. Mistral AI

A European powerhouse offering open-weights models that can be accessed via their "La Plateforme" API.

* **Key Models:**
* **Pixtral 12B:** Their first native multimodal model. It is 12 billion parameters, making it relatively lightweight but capable of processing images alongside text.
* **Mistral Large:** Their flagship model often has multimodal capabilities depending on the specific API endpoint version.


* **Best For:** Developers who prefer open-weight architectures and European data residency compliance.

### 7. Other Specialized Providers

* **Replicate:** A service that hosts thousands of open-source models via API. This is the best place to run open-source vision models like **Llava (Large Language-and-Vision Assistant)**, **Qwen-VL** (from Alibaba), or **YOLO** (for object detection) without managing your own GPUs.
* **Hugging Face Inference Endpoints:** Similar to Replicate, allows you to deploy almost any vision model from the Hugging Face Hub (like **Idefics2** or **BakLLaVA**) on dedicated infrastructure.

### Summary Table
