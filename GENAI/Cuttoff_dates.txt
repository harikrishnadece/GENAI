Act as AI LLM Expert and get me the cutoff date for Chatgpt,Qwen and Deepseek 



Here are the knowledge cutoff dates for the latest flagship models from OpenAI, Qwen (Alibaba), and DeepSeek.

**Key Distinction:** The "knowledge cutoff" refers to the date up to which the model was *trained*.

* **ChatGPT** can access the internet to find newer information.
* **DeepSeek** and **Qwen** (via API or standard interfaces) usually rely solely on their training data unless connected to a search tool by a third-party application.

### 1. ChatGPT (OpenAI)

OpenAI explicitly publishes its cutoff dates in its documentation.

| Model | Knowledge Cutoff | Release Date |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **GPT-4o** | **October 2023** | May 2024 |
| **o1 (Reasoning)** | **October 2023** | Sept 2024 |
| **GPT-4 Turbo** | December 2023 | April 2024 |

> **Note:** Even though GPT-4o's internal knowledge stops at Oct 2023, the *ChatGPT product* uses a search tool (Bing) to answer questions about events happening today.

### 2. DeepSeek

DeepSeek is generally more current than OpenAI's base models regarding internal training data.

| Model | Knowledge Cutoff | Release Date |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **DeepSeek-V3** | **July 2024** | Dec 2024 |
| **DeepSeek-R1** | **July 2024** | Jan 2025 |

> **Note:** Users often find DeepSeek models claiming an "October 2023" cutoff. This is widely considered a "hallucination" where the model accidentally mimics OpenAI's system prompts. The actual training data includes events up to July 2024.

### 3. Qwen (Alibaba)

Alibaba does not officially highlight a specific "knowledge cutoff" date in their technical reports as prominently as OpenAI does. However, based on release timing and community testing:

| Model | Est. Knowledge Cutoff | Release Date |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Qwen 2.5** | **June 2024** (Estimated) | Sept 2024 |
| **Qwen 2.5-VL** | **Late 2024** (Estimated) | Jan 2025 |

> **Note:** The "Coder" variants of Qwen 2.5 share the same base pre-training, placing their general world knowledge cutoff around mid-2024 as well.

### Summary Comparison

* **Most Current Internal Knowledge:** **DeepSeek-V3 / R1** (July 2024)
* **Best for Real-Time Events:** **ChatGPT** (Due to integrated Web Search features, not internal training).
